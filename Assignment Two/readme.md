# Python Assignment: Operators and If-Else Statements  

This repository contains solutions for a Python assignment focused on using operators and if-else statements. The assignment includes building a simple arithmetic calculator and a student grade system calculator.  

## Assignment Overview  

The assignment covers the following concepts:  
- Arithmetic Operators  
- Comparison Operators  
- Logical Operators  
- Conditional Statements (`if`, `elif`, `else`)  

### Tasks Breakdown  

1. **Arithmetic Calculator:**  
   - Perform basic arithmetic operations: addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and modulus.  
   - Take user input for two numbers and the desired operation.  
   - Handle invalid operations with appropriate error messages.  

2. **Student Grade System Calculator:**  
   - Accept marks for multiple subjects from the user.  
   - Calculate the total and percentage.  
   - Assign grades based on the percentage using the following criteria:  
     - 90% and above → A+  
     - 80% - 89% → A  
     - 70% - 79% → B  
     - 60% - 69% → C  
     - 50% - 59% → D  
     - Below 50% → F  
   - Display the total marks, percentage, and grade.  

## How to Run

## Example Usage  

**Arithmetic Calculator:**  
```
Enter first number: 10  
Enter second number: 5  
Enter operation (+, -, *, /, %): *  
Result: 50  
```  

**Student Grade System Calculator:**  
```
Enter marks for Math: 85  
Enter marks for Science: 92  
Enter marks for English: 78  
Total Marks: 255  
Percentage: 85.0%  
Grade: A  
```
