# Python Assignment: Lists, Tuples, and Methods  

This repository contains solutions for a Python assignment focused on working with lists, tuples, and their methods. The tasks range from basic operations to more advanced problem-solving using functions.  

## Assignment Overview  

The assignment covers the following topics:  
- Basic List Operations  
- Intermediate List Operations  
- Tuple-Based Questions  
- Advanced Problems  

### Tasks Breakdown  

1. **Basic List Operations:**  
   - Appending elements to a list.  
   - Extending lists with other lists.  
   - Inserting elements at specific indices.  
   - Removing elements using `remove()` and `pop()` methods.  

2. **Intermediate List Operations:**  
   - Counting occurrences of elements.  
   - Sorting lists in ascending and descending order.  
   - Reversing lists.  
   - Copying and clearing lists.  

3. **Tuple-Based Questions:**  
   - Accessing elements of a tuple.  
   - Converting tuples to lists and back to tuples.  
   - Understanding tuple immutability and indirect modification techniques.  
   - Unpacking tuples.  
   - Counting element occurrences in tuples.  

4. **Advanced Problems:**  
   - Removing even numbers from a list.  
   - Sorting lists without using built-in sort methods.  
   - Removing duplicates from a list.  
   - Converting tuples to lists, modifying them, and converting them back.  
   - Separating mixed data types into different lists.
